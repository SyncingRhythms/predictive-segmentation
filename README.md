# Predicting Customer Segment with product and customer clustering

Product and Customer segmentation of eCommerce data

## Description

I wrangled, analyzed, and modeled the Online Retail II Dataset (01/12/2009-09/12/2011; link below) to understand product distributions across customers and within their purchased baskets.

The original dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii)
